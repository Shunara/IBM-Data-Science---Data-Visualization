# IBM-Data-Science---Data-Visualization
In this project, I made an interactive dashboard based on the data from domestic flights in the US from 2005 to 2020, totally made in Python. There are some images attached to this project for you to annalyze it, if you want to, and I recommend you to use Google Colab to test the project if you want to.
